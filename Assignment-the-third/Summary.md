<!-- # Write counts to output text file
# add the rest of this math to the markdown file with plots and stuff
#     Matched total count (matchcount)
#         should equal total records in matched r1 files
#         should equal total records in matched r2 files
#         include breakdown of matched record counts for each of 24 indices

#     Unknown total count
#         should equal unkcount + qualcount
#         should equal total records in r1 unknown file
#         should equal total records in r2 unknown file

#     Index hopped total count
#         should equal number of records in index hopped r1 file
#         should equal number of records in index hopped r2 file
#         should equal sum of values in index hopped count dictionary
#         include breakdown of counts for each identified wrong index pair

#     Total number of records in all output files
#         should equal total number of records in input files

# add plots! 
# proportion of reads in each sample?
